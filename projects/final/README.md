# Final Project

Your final project is an open-ended creative proposal that builds off or is inspired by the concepts in this class. The focus is on developing and documenting your idea. You'll propose a computational/creative work and create a sketch that represents a first step or proof of concept.

- **Focus on concept** - There is no requirement to use a particular aspect of programming. Focus on an idea that excites you and choose the best programming concepts and tools to help you realize it.
- **Build or Create Anew** - You can take something you’ve already made and develop it further or create something entirely new.
- **Scope** - Scope - Keep things simple and small in scope. If your project idea is a big one, document the larger vision and create a sketch that explores just one aspect, interaction, or element as a proof of concept. Think of the code component like the research project: an exploratory beginning, not a finished piece.
- **Audience** - Also consider making a final project for a small audience such as our class or for a single person like a family member, friend, or yourself as a way to focus your idea and design process.

The final project includes:

- Presenting an initial proposal to the class.
- Play testing a prototype sketch.
- Creating documentation of the final proposal and accompanying prototype in the form of a google slides deck (or format of your choice) to be presented in up to 10 minutes in the final class.

## Final Project Proposal: Due 11/19

Research your project and collect some notes, such as:

- **Inspirations** • How did you become interested in this idea? quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills
- **Source material** • Drawings, images, videos, sounds, text
- **Code** • Your own sketches and/or other people's sketches
- **Ideas for title** • And maybe a 1-sentence description?
- **Context** • What is the story? Who's it for? How will people experience it? Is it interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke something?

- Create a short slide deck to share. your proposal. Consider using the list above as an outline to illustrate what’s in your head, e.g. include some keywords, images, or embed video, etc. Everyone will have 5-10 minutes each to share in our next class.

## Prototype Sketch: Due 12/3

Create a simple p5.js sketch that represents a first step or proof of concept for your idea. This should be exploratory and experimental, not a complete implementation! Ask yourself: "What's one small thing I can code to start exploring this idea?"

For example, you might:

- Test out a visual style, pattern, or aesthetic
- Prototype a single interaction or behavior
- Experiment with a data source or algorithm
- Create one small piece of the larger system
- Explore the mood or feeling you're aiming for

We'll share and playtest these sketches informally in class in Week 13.

## Final Documentation & Presentation: Due 12/10

Create documentation of your project in the form of a Google Slides deck (or format of your choice) to be presented in up to 10 minutes in the final class. This should include:

- Your concept and what inspired it
- Visual documentation (images, videos, diagrams, mockups showing what the full vision could be)
- Your p5.js sketch and how it connects to the larger idea
- What you learned in the process
- Technical approach: what programming concepts or tools are involved?
