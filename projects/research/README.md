# Computational Arts Research Project

Find an example of computational art, design, or creative work that inspires you. This could be anything from ancient pattern-making traditions to modern digital art or pop culture that uses algorithmic approaches. The key is that it involves computational, rule-based processes similar to what we've been exploring in code.

- Traditional analog pattern systems
- Early computer art
- Contemporary art
- Interactive installations
- Generative design
- Internet/social media art
- and more!

Your research will result in three components: written documentation, a short presentation, and a p5.js sketch inspired by your chosen work.

### Starting Points for Research

- [ITP's Computationam Media Inspiration Wiki](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2025-Code/wiki/Inspiration)
- [Generative Art References](https://github.com/shiffman/Creative-Computing-F25/tree/main/03-repetition#inspiration)

## Part 1: Written Research (300-500 words)

Write a summary that covers:

**About the Work:**

- Who created it and when?
- What tools, materials, or processes were used?
- How does the work function or behave?
- What does it look like, sound like, or feel like to experience?

**Connections to Creative Computing:**

- How does this work relate to concepts we've learned?
- What systematic rules or patterns can you identify?
- Why does this work inspire you?
- What questions does it raise about creativity, technology, or art-making?

You can write directly in Brightspace or use another platform (Notion, blog post, Google Doc, etc.) and link to it.

## Part 2: p5.js Sketch

Create a p5.js sketch that responds to or is inspired by your chosen work. This should be simple and exploratory, not a recreation or finished artwork! Think of it like the weekly exercises: a basic sketch that connects to your chosen work in whatever way feels meaningful to you. Maybe you explore a color palette, recreate a simple pattern, or experiment with a similar process.

## Part 3: Presentation (5-7 minutes)

Create a short slide presentation (Google Slides, Keynote, etc.) that introduces your chosen work to the class and summarizes the key elements from your written research. Include visuals (images, videos, diagrams). Your presentation can be conversational, not formal. Include:

- Showing us the work (what it looks like/does)
- Explaining why you picked it
- Highlighting connections to class concepts
- Sharing what surprised or inspired you in your research
- Your p5.js sketch and how it connects to the work

## Submission

Submit all three components in your Brightspace post:

- Your written research (or link to external document)
- Link to your presentation slides
- Link to your p5.js sketch and a screenshot

## Timeline

**Step 1 (Due 10/1):** Pick your topic!

- Link to your chosen work
- Write 2-3 sentences explaining why you picked it and what interests you about it

**Step 2 (Due 10/8):** Complete project and present

- Submit final written research, p5.js sketch, and presentation slides
- Present to class (5-7 minutes)
