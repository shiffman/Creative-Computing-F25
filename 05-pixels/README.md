# Images & Pixels

## Working with Images

- Loading and displaying images with `loadImage()` and `image()`
- Image positioning, sizing, and tinting
- The pixel array and how images are stored as data
- Accessing and modifying individual pixels
- Accessing webcam with `createCapture()`
- Working with live video as a data source

### Pixel Manipulation Sketch

For this assignment, create an interactive sketch that processes image or video data. You can use any of the above examples as a launching off point. If you'd like a more specific prompt, my suggestion is to create an interactive "mirror" with `createCapture()`. How can you transform the live video in creative ways? Consider manipulating brightness, color, position, or creating your own "mechanical mirror" by drawing shapes or text that represent pixels.

### Documentation

Along with screenshots and notes on your creative process (what you tried, challenges, what you learned), reflect on Danny Rozin's interview. Here are two prompts to consider.

- Rozin talks about seeing "patterns of light and dark" and finding "pixels in almost everything." After working with pixel arrays, do you see the world differently?
- In his software mirrors, Rozin explores questions like: "What amount of information is required to make an image? How much can you subtract from an image until it loses its meaning?" How did your sketch explore the boundaries between abstraction and recognition?
