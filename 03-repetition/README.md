# Repetition & Generative Art

## Loops

- The `for` loop and `while` loop structures
- Using loops to repeat drawing operations
- Nested loops for creating grids and patterns
- Adding variation within repetition

## Arrays

- Storing multiple values in a single variable
- Combining arrays with loops
- Managing collections of data for animation and interaction

## Assignment

### Reading

- [An Interview with Vera Molnar](https://www.rightclicksave.com/article/an-interview-with-vera-molnar)

### Generative Sketch

Create a "generative" artwork that implements the concept of repetition with variation. Use at least one for loop. (Note that this assignment might be easier if you consider making it non-interactive. Try putting `noLoop();` in your `setup()` function.)

Think about how you can design a system that creates unexpected results within boundaries you set. Consider using `random()` strategically rather than everywhere. What happens when you control some elements while letting others vary?

**Need a starting point?** Try implementing your own version of 10PRINT!

### Documentation

Along with screenshots and notes on your creative process, reflect on the Vera Molnar interview:

- Molnar said "I may not find, but I seek" - she experimented to see what would happen. How did experimenting with your code lead to surprises?
- What "rules" did you give your code? (Like: draw circles in a grid, make some red, some blue, etc.) How did following these simple rules create something you didn't expect?
- Molnar used randomness to help make decisions in her art. Where did you use `random()` in your sketch and why?
- Did you like everything your code made, or did you pick your favorites? What made some results better than others?
