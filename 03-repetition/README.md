# Repetition & Generative Art

## Loops

- The `for` loop and `while` loop structures
- Using loops to repeat drawing operations
- Nested loops for creating grids and patterns
- Adding variation within repetition

## Arrays

- Storing multiple values in a single variable
- Combining arrays with loops
- Managing collections of data for animation and interaction

## Assignment

### Reading

- [Why We Love Generative Art](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art) by Jason Bailey

### Generative Sketch

Create a "generative" artwork that implements the concept of repetition with variation. Use at least one for loop. (Note that this assignment might be easier if you consider making it non-interactive. Try putting `noLoop();` in your `setup()` function.)

Think about how you can design a system that creates unexpected results within boundaries you set. Consider using `random()` strategically rather than everywhere. What happens when you control some elements while letting others vary?

**Need a starting point?** Try implementing your own version of 10PRINT!

### Documentation

Along with screenshots and notes on your creative process, reflect on Bailey's article about generative art:

- How did designing a system (rather than directly drawing each element) change your approach to making a p5.js sketch?
- Bailey writes about "controlled randomness." How did you balance control and chance in your sketch?
- What surprised you about what your code produced? Did the system create anything you didn't expect?
- Bailey suggests generative art continues traditions of "geometry, abstraction, and chance" from 20th-century art. Do you see connections between your computational work and other forms of art you know?
