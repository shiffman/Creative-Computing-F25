## Assignment

Take a p5.js sketch you made for a previous assignment and incorporate sound using one or more of the following suggestions:

- Use volume levels from the microphone input or from playing a sound file to change something in the canvas. For example, color or size of a shape.
- Play a sound effect when an event occurs (such as a circle bounces off the edge of the canvas).
- Create your own “sound synthesis “ sketch that ties a visual element to a synthesized sound. For example, the x position of a moving circle might control the frequency of an oscillator or filter. What other effects / parameters can you control?
