# Organization: Functions & Objects

_The videos in this section were created using a different editor for p5.js. All of the concepts should still apply, however, there are some minor changes. Most notably in JavaScript `let` is now the preferred way to declare a variable over `var`. If you would like to learn more about this you can [watch this video about let vs var](https://youtu.be/q8SHaDQdul0)._

## Modularity and Reusability

- Breaking code into reusable pieces
- Function parameters and arguments
- Returning values from functions
- Local vs. global scope

## Objects and Classes

- Organizing data and behavior together
- Creating custom classes
- Constructor functions and properties
- Methods for object behavior
- Managing multiple objects with arrays

## Assignment

### Computational Arts Research Project

This week begins a two-week research project where you'll explore computational art that inspires you and create your own p5.js response to it.

**Step 1 (due this week):** Pick your topic and submit a brief proposal  
**Step 2 (due next week):** Complete research, create sketch, and present to class

See the full assignment details: [Computational Arts Research Project](../projects/research/README.md)
