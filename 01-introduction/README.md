## Assignment

### p5.js sketch

- Create a "self" portrait using 2D primitive shapes. Play with symmetry in your portrait. Shapes include – `arc()`, `curve()`, `ellipse()`, `line()`, `point()`, `quad()`, `rect()`, `triangle()` – and basic color functions – `background()`, `colorMode()`, `fill()`, `noFill()`, `noStroke()`, `stroke()`. Remember to use `createCanvas()` to specify the dimensions of your window and wrap all of your code inside a `setup()` function. Here's an example: [Zoog](https://editor.p5js.org/mimiyin/sketches/SiMFwzSGS)

### Reading Response

Watch [Red In Her Own Words](https://vimeo.com/78544041).

It is important to be able to develop questions. This course is more about why to program than how to program. The answer is likely to be different and personal to each of you.

- What has been your relationship with technology in general?
- What has been your relationship with technology?
- What are your curiosities about creative coding?
- What are the questions you hope to explore in this class?

Write a paragraph or two using the above as prompts. Riff off of anything in this prompt, from Red’s video, discussion in class, or anything on your mind. Don’t respond to everything, just pick something and write about it. Revisit this at the end of the semester.
