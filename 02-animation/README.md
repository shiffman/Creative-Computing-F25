# Animation & Variables

## Sketch Flow

- The `setup()` and `draw()` functions
- Event functions: `mousePressed()`, `keyPressed()`, etc.
- Animation loops and frame rates
- Built-in variables: `mouseX`, `mouseY`, `width`, `height`
- Creating your own variables with `let`
- variable scope
- `console.log`
- Variable types: numbers, strings, booleans
- `random()`, `map()`, `sin()`, `cos()`

## Oh, also transformations

- Moving the coordinate system
- Rotating and scaling shapes
- Saving and restoring transformations

## Conditional Logic

- The `if` statement
- Relational operators: `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `===`, `!==`
- `else` and `else if` statements
- Logical operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR)
- Boolean variables: `true` and `false`

## Assignment

### Reading

- <a href="https://mres.medium.com/computational-fluency-776143c8d725" target="_blank">Computational Fluency</a> by Mitch Resnick

### Animated Sketch

This week you'll build on animation, variables, and conditionals to make something interactive. Choose one of the options below (or invent your own):

- **Animate Your Week 1 Sketch**: Take your sketch from last week and bring a small element to life! Since your drawing is likely quite complex with many shapes and lines of code, consider simplifying by removing most of the code and focusing on animating just one element. Making the eyes blink, adding a subtle head tilt, animating hair swaying are some ideas. Do they move with the mouse or on their own?
- **Painting Sketch**: Create an interactive drawing sketch that responds to user input. How can you use variables to store drawing properties (brush size, color, etc.) and conditionals for different modes and effects?
- **Bouncing Animation**: Building on top of the bouncing ball example, how can you add variables to control speed, size, or other properties of the ball? How can you use conditionals or mathematical operations for the ball to interact with the mouse?
- **Clock**: Invent your own visual representation of time! (See the [Clock Coding
  Challenge video](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/74-clock).)

### Documentation

Along with screenshots and notes on your creative process (what you tried, challenges, what you learned), reflect on the reading as part of your post. Use Resnickâ€™s idea of _computational fluency_ to frame your work:

- How did your sketch let you **express yourself** (not just solve a puzzle)?
- In what ways did variables, conditionals, or animation feel like tools for developing your **voice** in code?
- Do you see a connection between learning to code and learning to write, as Resnick suggests?

This week, you can include these reflections in the same post as your sketch documentation.
