# Animation & Variables

## Sketch Flow

- ⏰ The `setup()` and `draw()` functions
- 🖱️ Event functions: `mousePressed()`, `keyPressed()`, etc.
- 🔄 Animation loops and frame rates
- 📦 Built-in variables: `mouseX`, `mouseY`, `width`, `height`
- ✏️ Creating your own variables with `let`
- variable scope
- `console.log`
- 🔢 Variable types: numbers, strings, booleans

## Conditional Logic

- ❓ The `if` statement
- ⚖️ Relational operators: `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `===`, `!==`
- 🔀 `else` and `else if` statements
- 🔗 Logical operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR)
- ✅ Boolean variables: `true` and `false`

## Assignment

### Animated Sketch

Create an animated, interactive sketch that builds on top of the in-class demonstrations. Here are three choices (you should only pick one!) or you can invent your own.

- Painting Sketch: create an interactive drawing sketch that responds to user input. How can you use variables to store drawing properties (brush size, color, etc) and conditionals for different modes and effects?
- Bouncing Animation: Building on top of the bouncing ball example, how can you add variables to control speed, size, or other properties of the ball? How can you leverage conditionals or mathematical operations for the ball to interact with the mouse?
- Clock: Invent your own visual representation of time!

**Documentation**: Document your creative process! Include screenshots of your sketch, describe what you attempted, any challenges you encountered, and what you learned. Include any questions you have in your post!
